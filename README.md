Handwritten Text Recognition using Deep Learning with TensorFlow.

## Abstract
Handwritten notes are commonly used to write and share information. However, since they are written on paper, it is difficult to search for specific content, store them, and share them easily. By turning handwritten notes into digital files, we can enjoy many advantages, such as being able to search for information quickly, store them in a better way, and use advanced techniques to analyze the data they contain
During this text recognition, we process the input image, extraction of features, and classification schema takes place, training of system to acknowledge the text. During this approach, the system is trained to seek out the similarities, and also the differences among various handwritten samples. This application takes the image of a hand transcription and converts it into a digital text

## Proposed Work
For the task at hand, a Neural Network (NN) is utilized, which comprises several types of layers. These layers include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layers, and a final layer known as Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layer. The CNN layers are responsible for extracting features from the input images, while the RNN layers capture the sequential dependencies within the extracted features. The CTC layer is used for decoding the sequential predictions into the final recognized text.
