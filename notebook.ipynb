    "Image processing could be a manipulation of images within the computer vision.There are many techniques for the manipulation of the images. The character recognition involves several steps like acquisition, feature extraction, classification, and recognition. Handwriting recognition is the ability of a machine to receive and interpret the handwritten input from an external source like image. The most aim of this project is to model a system that may efficiently recognize the actual character of format employing a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handwriting recognition system handles formatting, performs correct segmentation into characters, and finds the foremost plausible words. Off-line handwriting recognition involves the automated conversion of the text in a picture into letter codes that are usable within computer and text-processing applications. the info obtained by this manner is considered a static representation of handwriting."

These techniques handle different types of images, including handwritten documents and documents with colored backgrounds. They also deal with varying intensities of images. The offline character recognition method proposed involves diagonal feature extraction and relies on an ANN model. Two approaches for creating a neural network system are discussed, one with 54 features and the other with 69 features.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A system for offline cursive handwriting recognition is described by A. Brakensiek, J. Rottland, A. Kosmala, and J. Rigoll. The system is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and uses discrete and hybrid modeling techniques. R. Bajaj, L. Dey, and S. Chaudhari employ three different styles of features (density, moment, and descriptive component features) for classifying Devanagari Numerals, achieving an accuracy of 89.6% for handwritten Devanagari numerals.\n",
    "\n",
    ">M. Hanumadhulu and O.V. Ramanammurty implement a fuzzy set approach using the box method, achieving a recognition accuracy of 90%. This model works with various sources of information. Previous research has shown that this model performs well with diverse information sources, but it may be less accurate when dealing with long sentences. Many proposed models struggle to accurately classify long text data. On the other hand, models incorporating CNN networks are showing promising results due to their ability to handle longer text data."

Next, the non-linear ReLU function is applied to introduce non-linearity. Finally, a pooling layer summarizes image regions and produces a downsized version of the input.

    "#### Blank Token:\n",
    "To handle this, the Blank token comes into play. It serves as a placeholder that doesn't carry any meaning and is simply removed before generating the final output word. Here's how the algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The CTC network assigns the character with the highest probability to each input sequence.\n",
    "2. Repeated characters without a blank token in between are merged.\n",
    "3. Finally, the blank token is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By summing the probabilities of the characters at each time step, the CTC network can provide the probability label for the input. The CTC algorithm is alignment-free, meaning it doesn't require precise alignment between the input and output. However, to calculate the loss function, it considers the probabilities of all possible alignments between the two. Understanding these alignments is crucial in determining how the loss function is ultimately calculated.\n",
